/* Questions 
 * (c) How can the problem be broken into multiple subproblems of the same type?
 Iteration of each value being reduced by 1 so subproblem of 9 would be 6 subproblem of 3 would be zero and so on
 * (d) How does each recursive call diminish the size of the problem?
 Each recursive call decreases the value until the base case is reached
 * (e) What instance of the problem space serve as the base case?
 If the value equals 1 the recursion stops so at 1 is the base case
 * (f) Will this solution _always_ reach the base case? If not, explain why
 No, because the base case could be passed if the initial value is not a multiple of 3
 * (g) What change can be made to make the solution correct
 Change the condition from value != 1 to value > 1
 * (h) What change can be made to make the solution correct
