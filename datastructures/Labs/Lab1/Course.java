 * @Lab 1
 * @class Course
 * @Disclaimer Any and all work in this file is my own
 * @Question
 *  Create a new public class called Course that contains a private
 *  final integer called MAX_ENROLLED_STUDENTS and set it equal to 5.
 * 
 *  The class should also have a
 *  * private array variable to hold the students in the course,
 *  * an enrollment variable (of type int) to hold how many students
 *  are currently enrolled in the course,
 *  * a variable of type Instructor to hold the courseâ€™s instructor and
 *  * two string values to hold its course code and the name of the course.
 * 
 *  Add a constructor that receives two strings: one for the code and
 *  one for the name. Set the class variables and initialize the array
 *  variable.
 * 
 *  Add an {@code enroll(Student student)} method to add a student to
 *  the course, making sure to check that the student can be enrolled first.
 * 
 *  Add the {@code unenroll(Student student)} method to remove the
 *  student from the course,
 *  * checking if (a) there are students in the course,
 *  * and (b) the student being removed is actually in the course.
 * 
 *  Add the {@code assignGrade(Student student, double grade)} method
 *  to assign the student a grade in the course and change their
 *  average according to the formula (average + grade) / 2.
 * 
 *  Add any other appropriate set and get methods, keeping in mind the
 *  principle of information hiding, and what we do or donâ€™t want our
 *  users to access or change.
 * 
 *  Finally, add a toString method to print something like
 *  <p><code>ðŸ“š Course [ code = COSC123, name = COSC course 1, instructor = Jamie Remstone, enrolled = 0 ]</code></p>
