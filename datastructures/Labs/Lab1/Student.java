 * @Disclaimer Any and all work in this file is my own
 * @Question
 *  Create a new public class called Student that extends the Person class.
 * 
 * Create a private double variable for the studentâ€™s average (this should be initialized to zero) and
 * 
 *  a constructor that takes in the personâ€™s id and name. (Hint: The only line in this constructor should be a super call). 
 * 
 * Implement the appropriate set and get methods. 
 * 
 * Override the toString method to display something like Student
 * <p><code>ðŸŽ“ Student [ id = 123, name = Lucas, average = 96.78% ]</code></p>
