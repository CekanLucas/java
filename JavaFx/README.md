## Project Structure
`bin`: This directory contains the compiled class files and resources. The main directory under bin corresponds to the package structure (org.openjfx) of your Java classes. The compiled class files (*.class) and resource files (*.fxml, *.css) are located here.

`build`: This directory contains the build output generated by Gradle. It includes compiled classes, generated source files, resource files, distribution packages, and temporary build directories.

`build.gradle`: This file is the Gradle build configuration file for your project. It defines the project's dependencies, tasks, and other build settings.
